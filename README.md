Overview
This repository contains the Data Science and MLOps in Industry project, which applies data science techniques and MLOps practices to build a robust machine learning pipeline. The project aims to automate data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, followed by deployment and real-time monitoring to ensure scalable and efficient operations in real-world environments. The project incorporates tools like Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Flask for model deployment, and uses MLflow for model versioning and tracking.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure the following tools are available:

Python 3.6 or higher
The following libraries:
scikit-learn: For building machine learning models
pandas: For data manipulation
numpy: For numerical operations
TensorFlow: For deep learning models
Flask: For creating a REST API for model deployment
MLflow: For model tracking and versioning
matplotlib/ seaborn: For data visualization
Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Darshanjain25933/Datascience-landops-industry-.git
Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application
To launch the model deployment, execute the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
This will start the application locally, allowing you to test and interact with the model.

Project Implementation Steps:
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Clean and normalize the dataset, handle missing values, and engineer features.
Model Development: Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to train the model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model using Flask to create an API for production usage.
Real-time Monitoring: Continuously monitor the model's performance using MLflow and real-time logs.
Model Retraining: Automate periodic model retraining based on new data to ensure model accuracy over time.
Bonus Features - Security & Performance:
Integrated model versioning with MLflow for easy tracking of model changes and performance over time.
Implemented real-time monitoring of model performance, detecting any model drift or degradation.
Optimized the deployment process using containerization, ensuring scalability and efficient resource management.
The project also utilizes Docker for environment isolation and deployment consistency.
